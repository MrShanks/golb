# HOW TO START WITH TDD

## The madness of TDD

---

Starting with writing tests sounds kinda wrong, doesn't it?
Well in my opinion TDD is one of the things that makes programming now a day
actually enojoyable.

I know madning, but that's how it is, at least for me. And I can assure you
that you will start writing better code if you give it a chance.

But it won't happen over time. TDD is hard and you need to practice it to get
it right. Isn't like that for every single thing in life.
